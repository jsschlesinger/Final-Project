# Network Topology

## The following machines were identified on the network:
  
  - Hypervisor / Host Machine 
   -  Operating System: Microsoft Windows
   -  Purpose: Hypervisor / Gateway
   -  IP Address: 192.168.1.1
      
  - ELK
   -  Operating System: Linux
   -  Purpose: SIEM
   -  IP Address: 192.168.1.100
      
  - Capstone
   -  Operating System: Linux
   -  Purpose: HTTP Server (Red Herring)
   -  IP Address: 192.168.1.105
      
  - Target 1
   -  Operating System: Linux
   -  Purpose: HTTP Server and Wordpress Site
   -  IP Address: 192.168.1.110


# Description of Targets

# The target of this attack was: Target 1 (192.168.1.110)

# Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:
  - Excessive HTTP Errors
  - HTTP Request Size Monitor
  - CPU Usage Monitor
    
# Monitoring the Targets

# Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:

# Excessive HTTP Errors

## Alert 1 is implemented as follows:
     - Metric: http.response.status_code > 400
     - Threshold: 5 in last 5 minutes
     - Vulnerability Mitigated: Able to identify brute force attacks
     - Reliability: Highly reliable, does not generate frequent false positives

# HTTP Request Size Monitor

## Alert 2 is implemented as follows:
     - Metric: http.request.bytes
     - Threshold: 3500 in last 1 minute
     - Vulnerability Mitigated: Protects against DDOS attacks
     - Reliability: Highly reliable, does not generate frequent false positives
      
# CPU Usage Monitor

## Alert 3 is implemented as follows:
     - Metric: system.process.cpu.total.pct
     - Threshold: 0.5 in last 5 minutes
     - Vulnerability Mitigated: Triggers a memory dump if stored information is generated
     - Reliability: Not very reliable, can generate frequent false positives
